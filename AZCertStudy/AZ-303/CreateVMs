Create a Linux VM with the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI includes the vm command to work with virtual machines in Azure. We can supply several subcommands to do specific tasks. The most common include:
Create a Linux VM with the Azure CLI

Sub-command 	Description
create 		Create a new virtual machine
deallocate 	Deallocate a virtual machine
delete 		Delete a virtual machine
list 		List the created virtual machines in your subscription
open-port 	Open a specific network port for inbound traffic
restart 	Restart a virtual machine
show 		Get the details for a virtual machine
start 		Start a stopped virtual machine
stop 		Stop a running virtual machine
update 		Update a property of a virtual machine

Let's start with the first one: az vm create. This command is used to create a virtual machine in a resource group. There are several parameters you can pass to configure all the aspects of the new VM. The four parameters that must be supplied are:

Parameter 	Description
--resource-group 	The resource group that will own the virtual machine, use [sandbox Resource Group].
--name 		The name of the virtual machine - must be unique within the resource group.
--image 	The operating system image to use to create the VM.
--location 	The region to place the VM in. Typically this would be close to the consumer of the VM. In this exercise, choose a location nearby from the following list.

In addition, it's helpful to add the --verbose flag to see progress while the VM is being created.

Create a Linux virtual machine

Let's create a new Linux virtual machine. Execute the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create an Ubuntu VM in the "West US" location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

az vm create \
  --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
  --location westus \
  --name SampleVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --verbose
